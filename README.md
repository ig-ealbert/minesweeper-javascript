# Minesweeper Game in JavaScript

This is the Minesweeper game implemented in HTML/CSS/JavaScript with tests written in QUnit.

The game provides a grid of different sizes based on difficulty.  The goal is to find all of the mines and flag them without left-clicking on any of them.  Right-clicking a space will flag it as a mine.  Right-clicking a flagged space will unflag it.  Left-clicking a mine is a game loss.  Left-clicking any non-flagged, non-mine space will display a number that indicates how many adjacent spaces have mines in them.  Use these numbers to find the mines.
